### No longer do you have to depend on Uncle Bob or Aunt Sally for recommendations on who the best mechanic in town is. Far too long have our members depended on simple anecdote and word of mouth for a dependable set of individuals that puts effort into taking care of vehicles.

### Accidents are a 'when', not an 'if'. We are wary of the perilous nature of driving, but these tough situations are exactly where Motopanion as a service shines bright.

## What it does
We provide immediate assistance for getting a quote from any car service in the area. Upload a picture to our site to receive quotes on the damage to your car. Then, search for the best services near you, using our interactive map built with HERE.com's API and Algolia's search abilities.

## How we built it
We built with Javascript and Python for this endeavor.

## Challenges we ran into
Integration of all separate member projects

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Integrating everyone's work.

## What we learned
Keep track of people's progress to see if they need any help
